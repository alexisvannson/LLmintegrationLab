## Data Sources

- **Atmospheric CO₂**: NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory
- **Grid Carbon Intensity**: Carbon Intensity API (UK)
- **Climate News**: NASA Climate RSS Feed
- **Emissions Factors**: IPCC, DEFRA, and scientific literature

## Key Innovations

### 1. Real-Time Data Integration
Unlike static calculators, this app pulls live climate data:
- Current atmospheric CO₂ levels
- Real-time electricity grid carbon intensity
- Latest climate news headlines

### 2. Context-Aware AI Analysis
Llama3:8b receives rich context including:
- Your personal usage patterns
- Historical trends
- Real-time climate conditions
- Regional factors
- Global benchmarks

The AI provides specific, actionable recommendations based on YOUR data, not generic advice.

### 3. Historical Intelligence
SQLite database tracks:
- All your calculations
- AI insights
- Trends over time
- Progress toward goals

### 4. Professional Visualization
Interactive Plotly charts:
- Trend analysis with Paris Agreement target overlay
- Category breakdowns (pie charts, stacked areas)
- Comparative benchmarking
- Progress gauges

## Testing Individual Components

Each module can be tested independently:

```bash
# Test climate data service
python -m src.services.climate_data

# Test database
python -m src.services.database

# Test LLM service (requires Ollama running)
python -m src.services.llm
```

## Example Use Cases

1. **Daily Tracking**: Log your footprint each day to identify patterns
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Test the impact of switching to electric vehicles, changing diet, etc.
3. **Goal Achievement**: Work toward Paris Agreement targets with AI guidance
4. **Education**: Learn about carbon emissions and climate science
5. **Workplace Sustainability**: Track team or organizational footprints

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- OAuth integration for personal data import (Google Maps timeline, energy bills)
- Multi-user support with team challenges
- Carbon offset marketplace integration
- Mobile app version
- Integration with smart home devices
- Flight and travel tracking
- Gamification with achievements

## Notes

- **Privacy**: All data is stored locally in SQLite. No external servers.
- **Accuracy**: Emissions factors are estimates based on scientific literature. Real-world values vary.
- **Internet**: Required for real-time climate data; app works offline with cached values.
- **Ollama**: Must be running for AI analysis features.
